ðŸŽ¶ðŸ’» Just Built a Music Playlist Generator in C!

Excited to share my latest project â€” a Music Playlist Generator created using the C programming language!

In this video, I demonstrate how a real music playlist works in the background through code.

I used a struct to store details like song name and created functions to:
-> Add a song to the playlist
-> Display the current playlist

Each new song is added to the end of a circular linked list, applying fundamental concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

We compile and run the program to test its functionality and see the playlist in action!

âœ¨ It Features: 
âœ… Custom song structure using struct
âœ… Add/Delete songs using linked lists

ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
C Language | GCC Compiler (Visual Studio Code)

I know that I havenâ€™t added subtitles or play/stop functions yet â€” but as I continue learning, I plan to upgrade it further, especially in terms of back-end logic and features.
